Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "CI2C1"     (component I2C_LDD)
   - CI2C1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - CI2C1_MasterSendBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes inclusive 
                of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The slave address must be 
                specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, "Target slave 
                address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The 
                state of transmission is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete or OnError). Data to be sent are 
                not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C1_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and then receives the block of characters from the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C1_SelectSlaveDevice -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave, 10-bit address or general 
                call value. Any send or receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected 
                by this method. This method is available for the MASTER mode.
   - CI2C1_GetStats -Returns receive/transmit statistics.
   - CI2C1_ClearStats -Clears the receive/transmit statistics. This method is available only when GetStats methos is enabled.
   - CI2C1_Main -This method is available only for polling mode. If interrupt service is disabled this method replaces the I2C 
                interrupt handler. This method should be called if Receive/SendBlock was invoked before in order to run the 
                reception/transmition.
   - CI2C1_GetDriverState -This method returns the current driver status.

Module "CI2C2"     (component I2C_LDD)
   - CI2C2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - CI2C2_MasterSendBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes inclusive 
                of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The slave address must be 
                specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, "Target slave 
                address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The 
                state of transmission is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete or OnError). Data to be sent are 
                not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C2_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and then receives the block of characters from the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C2_SelectSlaveDevice -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave, 10-bit address or general 
                call value. Any send or receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected 
                by this method. This method is available for the MASTER mode.
   - CI2C2_CheckBus -This method returns the status of the bus. If the START condition has been detected, the method returns 
                LDD_I2C_BUSY. If the STOP condition has been detected, the method returns LDD_I2C_IDLE.
   - CI2C2_GetStats -Returns receive/transmit statistics.
   - CI2C2_ClearStats -Clears the receive/transmit statistics. This method is available only when GetStats methos is enabled.

Module "SPI0"      (component SPISlave_LDD)
   - SPI0_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SPI0_SendBlock -This method sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission 
                is not completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - SPI0_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.
   - SPI0_GetBlockSentStatus -This method returns whether the transmitter is finished transmitting all data block. The status 
                flag is accumulated, after calling this method the status is returned and cleared (set to "false" state). This 
                method is available only if method SendBlock is enabled.
   - SPI0_CancelBlockTransmission -Immediately cancels running transmit process. Unsent data will never been sent. This method 
                is available only if the SendBlock method is enabled.
   - SPI0_CancelBlockReception -Immediately cancels the running receive process started by the ReceiveBlock method. Characters 
                already stored in the HW buffer will be lost. This method is available only if the ReceiveBlock method is 
                enabled.
   - SPI0_GetStats -Returns communication statistics (e.g. sent character count, parity error count).
   - SPI0_GetDriverState -This method returns the current driver status.

                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use

                Before the second call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - FLASH1_Read -This method sets up a flash memory read operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (property <Read batch size>) by periodical calling the component¡¯s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service).
   - FLASH1_Write -This method sets up a flash memory write operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (property <Write batch size>) by periodical calling the component¡¯s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service) or by the component¡¯s ISR, if an component¡¯s interrupt service is enabled.
   - FLASH1_Erase -This method sets up a flash memory erase operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (property <Erase batch size>) by periodical calling the component¡¯s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service) or by the component¡¯s ISR, if an component¡¯s interrupt service is enabled.
   - FLASH1_Main -This method is used to perform one batch of a flash memory operation. This method is used to perform batches 
                of all flash memory operations (Write, Read, Erase, EraseBlock, VerifyErasedBlock) when the component works in 
                the polled mode (interrupt service is disabled - property <Interrupt service>). This method performs batches of 
                the read flash memory operation, when the component works in the interrupt triggered mode (interrupt service is 
                enabled). This method is enabled only if the component works in the polled mode or if the Read method is 
                enabled.

Module "Timer_PIT" (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - Timer_PIT_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - Timer_PIT_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and 
                if counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
